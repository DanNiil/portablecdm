I want to learn to work more flexibly and get comfortable with agile development in team projects. Most of what I’ve done so far has been revised once or twice, with a fail or a pass, and most often only in collaboration with one other person. By the attitude of continuously reminding myself that what I’m doing is part of a bigger picture I think I can learn the most. 

I don’t know technically what I can help with without knowing the details about the project but I will do my best to contribute to a good environment within the team. I will most likely take the role of the scrum-master and strive for good communication within, but also outside (project owner, other groups), the team. 

Next week especially want further my understanding of:
- API-fetching using jQuery
- Getting comfortable with a github-repository with multiple collaborators
- Get more understanding of KPI’s so we can find the best ones for our project
- How to organize our project/scrum scheduling online (e.g. “Project”-tab on git or Fello)
